# Maximum-Profit-Producing-Stocks-Simulator

• Formulated an algorithm that chooses the stocks one could have invested in to generate maximum profits by using data from the Bloomberg Terminal
• Implemented the aforementioned algorithm and created a public domain website using HTML, Javascript, CSS and Java Swing/AWT 

Only the algorithm will be posted as the interface is proprietary and is going to go live soon.
